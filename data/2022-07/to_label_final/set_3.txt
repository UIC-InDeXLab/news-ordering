Suppose an average adult residing in the United States is viewing news headlines.
If the subject views headline A and headline B together,
will their impression of either story likely be different
from what it would have been if the subject had viewed them individually?
I.e., would viewing the headline of one story influence their
opinion on the veracity of the content of the other story or
the causes, effects, or benefits of the events discussed within?

For each question, you may answer "yes", "no", or "maybe".
Please replace "Y/N/M" with the corresponding letter.

There are a total of 55 questions.
The task is estimated to take 22 minutes to complete.
